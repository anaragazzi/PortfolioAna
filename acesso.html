								<h1>Acesso's chat area UX Design</h1>

							</header>

							<p class="major">
								Through the time I was working in Acesso one of my tasks was to improve the mobile app.
								Together with the UX team, I decided that it would be great to create a chat area to better
								distribute the demands of the customer service department and to improve the user experience.
								Here I will share some parts of this challenge.

					<h3>
						Acesso's App
					</h3>
					Acesso is a Prepaid Card fintech and its app is the best way for users to control and manage their money and expenses.
					Before this project, users could only communicate with customer service through telephone and email.
					<br>
				</p>
					<h3>
						My role
					</h3>
				<p>
					My main task was to design a great user experience in this new chat area. This is a very delicate area and I needed to
					create a simplistic however engaging experience where users could easily open tickets and had their problems solved.
					Acesso's interface was new and people were already using the app, so I needed to follow its Style Guide as well.

				<h3>
					What were the Customer Service needs?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Firstly I decided to talk to one of the customer service team members to better understand what they were expecting
					from this new feature. Here are some points made in the talk.

				<h3>
					How could I improve the User Experience?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Looking back to the user's point of view we decided to take a small online survey. In this research I asked them to
					tell us about their biggest problems related to Acesso's app. I also added some small but relevant things to improve
					their experience:
