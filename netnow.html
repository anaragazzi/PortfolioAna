								<h1>UX/UI Case Study for the Net Now app</h1>
							</header>

							<p class="major">
								In the beginning of 2018 I had the opportunity to create a new user interface design for the Net Now’s
								mobile app. In this challenge I had to propose a new feature for the searching area respecting
								the material design and the company branding guide. In this text I will share some of the process made to
								reach those objectives.

				<h3>
					But first, what is Net Now?
				</h3>

				<p>
					NET is the biggest cable TV operator in Brazil and Net Now is NET’s video on demand service. Most Net clients use
					Net Now through TV, but a few use the mobile app. Firstly I decided I would analyze NET NOW app and its
					competitors. NET NOW has a score of 3,0 in Google Play Store and more than 25,000 downloads.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Their competitors
				</h3>
				<p>Its first direct competitor is also a cable TV operator called Vivo Play. It has the same score on Google Play Store.
					However it’s not a very good reference since it has a lot of problems with structure, communication, and image
					qualities.
					<br>
					Other important competitors that have similar goals are Netflix, HBO GO, Globo Play, and Amazon Prime
					Video. Netflix is a really good and coherent app visually, but its searching area is not a very good reference for this project
					since its objective is not necessarily to help users find movies fast. HBO GO doesn’t present its content very well
					as well as Globo Play and Amazon Prime. Despite the small problems in their search area most of those apps have a
					better score than Net Now.

				<h3>
					How others apps behave
				</h3>
				<p>
					Looking back to Net Now mobile app, I found out that the search wasn’t a huge problem since it works just fine if the
					user knows exacly what he or she is looking for. However it might be difficult for the user to type the complete name of
					the content. To solve this problem I decided to insert a filter feature where the users can include more than just the name.
					They can use filters of types of contens and its genres. I decided to do a research in some well known apps such as
					Spotify, YouTube, IMDB, Google Drive, and Google Play Store to find more references about that. These apps have a lot
					of content but the search for a specific item is fast and easy, and a few suggested items are given below the best
					result.

						<h3>
							Spotify & YouTube

						<p>
							Both display the best result in highlight. With this feature, the user is able to find the result easier.

							<h3>
								IMDB

								Displays the result with an image and text which complements it with more information about the content, such
								as the cast and release year.

					<section>
						<center>

							<h3>
								Google Drive & Google Play
							</h3>
							<p>
								Since they both have a lot of products and different type of users, the apps use filters to better guide users.
								There are two filter levels which combined help even more in the search.

								Onboarding

							<p>
								Firstly, an onboarding is used to guide users in their first time in the searching area. This is a very good
								way to help the new and old users to use the new feature.

							<h3>
								Filters
							</h3>
							<p>
								My idea was to use permanent filters with the same categories used on the Smart TV’s app: movies, TV shows,
								releases, etc. In special occasions such as the Oscars and Grammys those filters may be changed.

								match the image cycles between stills of the content for a better view and space use.

								Personal List

								I also added an option where users can add contens to their own lists. This is a very useful feature found on
								the TV version of the app but missing on the mobile app.
