<p>Below you can find some works that I have done when I was working as an Art Director in Cappuccino Digital. These are advertising made for Tirolez (brazilian famous brand of cheese), Satis (Ajinomoto), Buscofem (Boehringer) and Tirolez, respectively, to be used on their Facebook pages.</p>

<p>The first post made for Tirolez can be translated to “In case of hunger, break the glass”.
The second post is a special post made for the Festa Junina, a typical celebration in Brazil for the commemoration of St. John’s day.
The third is for Buscofem (a very well known medicine for menstrual colic). This post can be translated as “The NO-MORE-PMS Factory”. 
The last post is a divulgation for the Edam cheese for Tirolez.<br>
The following images are special posts for the divulgation of Satis on Facebook. They were made with retouched and manipulated images from an online stock image.
