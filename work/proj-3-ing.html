<p>Below you can find some printed advertising works that I made when I was working in Biwa Brasil, between the years of 2011 and 2012.

<div class="img-proj-3">
	<img src="/assets/img/work/proj-3/img1.jpg" style="width: 342px; height: 248px; border-radius: 2px;"  data-action="zoom" alt="Advertising"/>
	<img src="/assets/img/work/proj-3/img2.jpg" style="width: 342px; height: 248px; border-radius: 2px;"  data-action="zoom" alt="Advertising"/>

</div>
<p>The work is mainly retouched and manipulated images. I took pictures off the jewels in a studio, and then I selected images from a online stock image to combine them.</p>

<div class="img-proj-3">
	<img src="/assets/img/work/proj-3/img3.jpg" data-action="zoom" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border-radius: 2px;" alt="Advertising"/>
</div>

<p>I love to retouch and to manipulate images. They take a lot of work, but I am always happy with the result. I had the opportunity of work with this again in Cappuccino Digital. You can see some of these works in the Social Media section.</p>
