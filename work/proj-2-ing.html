<p>In the end of 2015 I had the opportunity to work in a really cool project. My brother in law, Danniel Teller, got the chance to publish his first book and he invited me to do the cover. Before reading the book, he sent me several references on how he would like the art to be. He had a very complete idea of how the characters were like and how they should be represented. Since the beginning I was really excited with the possibility of having my work available in libraries.</p>

<p>After reading his book it became even easier to get our ideas together. Thereafter I started to create sketches of the characters.</p>

<p>Above you can see some of the first sketches of João, the main character. The definitive draw follows in the image bellow.</p>

<p>In the image above, you can see two of the main illustrations of the cover, João and the elders.</p>

<p>Here is the final digital illustration of the elders with the title and the final background. I used the <a href="http://www.dafont.com/pt/the-goldsmith-vintage.font" target="_blank">The Goldsmith Vintage</a> type by Eric Kurniawan. The reason I choose this type is because it has a great reading and it looks right out of a fantasy world.</p>

<p>In the image above you can see the final art of the cover. It was a fantastic experience, not alway easy but very pleasant to do. The book is available in Portuguese at <a href="http://editoramultifoco.com.br/loja/product/13o-universo-livro-um-a-longa-jornada/" target="_blank">Multifoco's</a> Website. It is a great investment, not only because of the cover but also because of the awesome story in the book.</p>
