					<h3>
						Design System definition
					</h3>
					A design system is a series of components that can be reused in different combinations. It allows
					designers to built in scale through different products and solutions within the same company.
					<br>
				</p>
				<h3>
					The goal
				</h3>
				As a team, we defined three mains goals:<br>
				1. Promote <b>consistency</b> across the brand allowing us to create a <b>unified experience</b> across
				all touch points with BIMobject.<br>
				2. Improve the <b>efficiency of development</b> by ensuring weâ€™re speaking the same language. It allows our
				conversations to be shaped less around low-level design, and more around what really matters. <br>
				3. Have a site in which developers and new employees can <b>easily extract all the design and
				solutions information</b> they need.



				<br>

					<h3>
						My role
					</h3>
				<p>
					Among the other designers on the Product department, I had to create components that would follow
					UX principles and correspond to the company's brand identity, vision, and mission.

				<h3>
					Design Inventory
				</h3>
				When I first started at BIMobject I saw that we had more than 10 websites/products. Each of them had
				different components with no structure. I knew a lot of users could get confused about where they
				were because of that.<br>
				To be able to visualise and analyse all the different designs we had, I decided to do a Design Inventory.
				<br>
				With that, I found out that we were using 2 different blue colors as our main BIMobject color,
				24 different CTAs, 7 font types, 4 different icon styles, 10 headers and 3 footers, among
				other things.

							<img src="images/designsystem/designinventory.png" alt=""  width="100%" align="center"/>

						</center>
					</div>

				</p>
				<br>
				Another discovery made when analysing the brand colors was that the original BIMobject blue (#00AEFF)
				was not following accessibility checklists. Most of the areas had the BIMobject blue as a background
				with white or black the content.

				<h3>
					Research
				</h3>
				Since we had a big number of websites and many complex products we decided to take a look into
				companies that had the same issue.
				The questions we made were: How those companies where differentiating their products made for
				different users? How were they keeping the consistency even though they had too many websites? How
				were they making clear for the user that they were in a regular website and on a product's website?
				<br>
				Some cool inspirations we found were: Adobe, Atlassian, and BIM&CO (one of our competitors)
				Atlassian was the one with the best solutions.

				I also investigated which were the needs of different departments through the company, like
				the marketing, customer service and sales.

				<h3>
					Recreating the color structure
				</h3>
				An important aspect of the company was that we had two main different types of users going through
				the products: end-users (those who would go to the portal to download a BIM object) and manufactures
				(companies who would use BIMobject to add their BIM object files on the portal).
				<br>
				Due to those discoveries and because I knew we could explore a lot since we didn't have concrete
				components, I decided to create new variations to the main colors and add complementary colors that
				could be used for different situations (such as to differentiate the products to specific users,
				feedback messages and illustrations). Next you can see the final colors I ended up with:

				<h3>
					New components
				</h3>
				After this, I started creating general components that I knew would be used through the
				websites/products (such as primary and secondary button, form types, font paragraph specification,
				and modals using the new feedback colors).
				<p>
					<div class="items medium">
						<center>
							<img src="images/designsystem/components6.png" alt=""  width="100%" align="center"/>
						</center>
					</div>

				</p>
				One problem that we found when recreating those components was the overall flow between the websites.
				Since we had too many different headers it was difficult to go back and forth. To solve that problem
				we created an unify header that could be used through all the websites. So the user could have the
				same experience, without feeling he/she was lost and with too many open tabs. Another decision was
				to eliminate all the unnecessary websites that were out of date.
				<br>
				This same problem was happening with the footers so the solution ended up being the same.
				<p>
					<div class="items medium">
						<center>
							<img src="images/designsystem/headers_footers.png" alt=""  width="100%" align="center"/>

							Last Headers and Footers created.
						</center>
					</div>

				</p>
				For the specific products in which the user needed to stay focus, we thought it would be better to
				just keep simple informations on the header. Still keeping it consistency with the other the products.

				<h3>
					Final thoughts
				</h3>
				It has been an enormous challenge creating the design system. What we achieve so far is a huge Zeplin
				library, the next step is to have all the components together on a live website in which marketing,
				developers, and other employees can download and reuse the components.<br>
				This is and will always be an ongoing project, we still face a lot of challenges in the design
				department. Since we are now four people creating and utilizing the components we need to always have
				a clear communication. It's not something always easy to do, but it's amazing to see how much
				progress we made in creating a consistent design inside the company.<br>
				You can check some of those components applied on the <a href="http://academy.bimobject.com" target="_blank">Academy website</a>.
