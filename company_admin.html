	<!-- Summary and role -->

				<p>

					<h2>
						Summary
					</h2>
					The Company Admin was the very first project I had the pleasure to work with when I started working at BIMobject in 2018.
					Before talking about all the challenges and processes faced along the way, I think it’s important to share a brief information
					about the company and what we do here.
					<br>
					Basically, BIMobject is a platform that allows users (e.g. architects, engineers, and designers) to visualize information and download building information modeling objects (BIM objects) from authentic manufacturers’ products. The Company Admin is the tool that allows manufacturers to add their content to the platform. There are other tools for manufacturers to analyse their products’ performance, but the Admin is the main tool for managing their products.
					<br>
					The core functions of the project are currently in its final steps and will soon be launched globally.

					<br>
				</p>
				<h3>
					My role
				</h3>
				I currently work as the lead designer for this project and so far I’ve been conducting Comparative/Competitive analysis,
				Design Sprints, User interviews, and designing both wireframes and High fidelity prototypes. I also constantly collaborate with
				other designers to make sure we keep a design consistency through all company products, providing a single and smooth experience
				for all our users.
				<br>
				In addition, I worked alongside a few developers and the Project Owner.

		<!-- The challenge -->

		<section class="wrapper style1">
			<div class="inner">

				<h2>
					The challenge
				</h2>
				Our goal for the project was to allow manufacturers to upload their products as fast and as easily as possible without having
				to rely on our customer success team so often. Another thing was to update the UI with the new Design System that was starting
				to take place (you can read more about that project in a separate article). Our ambitions were to create a strong foundation
				that embraced a rapidly evolving business and a more diverse user base.
				<br>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Our high-level goals were to:
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Develop a frictionless and intuitive self-service.</li>
						<li>Give manufacturers more control over their content.</li>
						<li>Create a platform for innovation and deeper engagement.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

		<!-- The progress -->

		<section class="wrapper style1">
			<div class="inner">

				<h2>
					The process
				</h2>
				<h3>
					Kickoff
				</h3>
				Without pre-existing insights, I partnered with our PO Kevon to explore how the existing manufacturers were using the solution.
				We talked with about fifteen existing customers and learned that the solution we currently had was not user friendly among other things.
				<p>
					<h4>
						Learnings
					</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Manufacturers would meet up with the Customer Success(CS) team to have an onboard meeting to learn technical terms and
							how to get around the website.
						</li>
						<li>
							The user could be someone in the marketing department or have roles such as Product Specialist, BIM specialist, and
							Products Manager depending on the side of the company. This means that people with different skills, knowledge, experiences,
							and daily work routines were visiting Admin.
						</li>
						<li>
							The users see BIMobject as a place to market their products globally.
						</li>
						<li>
							Some users wanted to have more freedom, without having to reach out to our teams to publish their products after a QA process,
							others thought that this was the best way to make sure every information was in place before going live.
						</li>
						<li>
							BIMobject is a global company, which also means that there are CS teams helping the manufacturers in slightly different ways.
							I.e. Some countries would be demanding specific information and others would be helping out a lot more (almost doing all the
							work for the manufacturers).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Combining the findings
					</h3>
					After this first step, we used some predefined design concepts that helped us visualizing our users and potential opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>
						Empathy Map
					</h4>
					<p>
						<div class="items medium">

								<img src="images/admin/empathy_map.png" alt=""  width="100%" align="center"/>

							</center>
						</div>

					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>
						How Might We
					</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><i>HMW</i> can allow the user full access and control over their content without dropping the platform’s content quality?</li>
						<li><i>HMW</i> create a solution that could help different countries to smoothly adapt to a single way of working?</li>

					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Competitors
					</h3>
					After that, we started to look for competitors. It was a tricky thing to do since BIMobject is the pioneer among other companies
					in the market. So our solution was to look into comparables. How CMS companies our solutions that had similar problems were
					solving them?

				<p>
					<h2>
						Design Sprint
					</h2>
					Before I could jump into designing, it was important to align our findings with the developers and the CS team as well as to
					define which peace of the product to start with. So we did our first Design Sprint and invited two developers who already had
					knowledge around the product and two CS team members. Stakeholders and people that had worked with the project before were also
					included to do the lightning talks and Q&A sections.
					<br>
					From that workshop, it was clearer for all involved people that we needed to start with the Single Product Creation (a separated
					Design Sprint would occur later on to focus specifically on the Bulk Upload of Products flow). And that an inbuilt onboarding could
					help our users navigate through the process so that they wouldn’t need to reach out to us for small and simple questions.

				A lot of work has been done after almost 2 years and we keep testing and modifying things. Here are a few high fidelity prototypes:

				<h2>
					Conclusion
				</h2>
				<p>
					<h3>
					Feedback
					</h3>
					Working on a B2B solution can be challenging, especially when it comes to collecting enough feedback that can sustain the
					decisions made along the way.
					<br>
					The solution has been constantly talking to our users in all different ways; through quantitative (surveys and Hotjar pulls) and qualitative
					(sending emails and booking online meetings to get a better understatement regardless of the user’s country) research.
					Since this first release consisted of only a small fraction of what the Company Admin is, we didn’t release it for all of our user bases,
					instead, we are allowed the user to opt-in for our new solution to see what their first impressions are.
					<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Next steps
					</h3>
					Our next steps are doing new experiments (e.g. how can the Bulk Upload function in a better way and how can we allow free trial users
					to use some parts of our system) and updating the UI and UX of existing and necessary functionalities (e.g. users and settings).
				<p>
					<h3>
						Final note
					</h3>
					This is an ongoing project and hasn’t been completely perfect and frictionless. Like any other project developed in any other company,
					we faced a lot of the times challenges related to company strategy changes, budget changes, fundamental people coming and going out
					of it. But I believe that this is ordinary and what I wanted to showcase here is my work process and how we finally made our way
					from transforming a product that was not user friendly, with numerous bugs into a self-service tool in which current and new users
					can find a way to upload their most precious information to our platform.
